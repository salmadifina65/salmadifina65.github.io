    <div class="col-10">
     So, my name is Salma Difina Putri. I live in Bogor and currently study in SMK-SMAK Bogor. I'm on eleventh grade, it's XI-8. I was born in Jakarta, 28 August 2004.

    <div class="col-10">
      I love poetry and philosophy. I also like to draw sometimes even if I'm not that good at it. I watched many random vids on YouTube too. I usually spend my time reading a book, watch movies, and singing (don't expect much). I also sometimes write, but not really. </div>

    </div>
    <div class="col-10">
      I hate many things, to be honest. Basic criteria of cruelty; people who cannot be kind to others, people who judge too much and unprovoked, I hate racism and such. I also am a picky eater, I dislikes seafood so much. I also hate jumpscare and people who are ignorant. I'm trying my best too.

    I love the 1975, Arctic Monkeys, Stray Kids, Lorde, Taylor Swift, The Neighbourhood. I also adore Jane Austen as a great writer for centuries. Whoever invented pastel colour deserve an award, to be honest.

     <h1 style="font-family: Cabin Sketch";> My Thoughts on Online Learning During Pandemic </h1>
<div class="container">
  <div class="row align-items-start">
    <div class="col">
      At the beginning of the pandemic, the info provided is time off. I made many plans to study on holidays, but it was extended to this day. During those times, I initially struggled to set a schedule. Often forget time and feel less productive. But as I got older, I became accustomed to this pandemic. More can make the most of time too.
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      The amount of free time given makes me have more time to think. It is very difficult to avoid negative thinking during a pandemic. I use the free time to start a lot of new hobbies and try things when I have free time. Plus participate in organization and socialize, so that I can reduce my free time.
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      There are many difficulties and conveniences that I face thanks to this pandemic. But I believe that every thing can do us good, so I try to accept everything with a positive thought that things will improve. I hope this pandemic ends soon and abandons the blessings and lessons it provides.
